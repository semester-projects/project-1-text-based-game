        A dimly lit room. Heavy curtains obscure the sunlight, casting the space in a grayish hue. The air is thick with the scent of coffee. On one side of the room, a desk cluttered with papers, open files, and a half-empty coffee cup. The only sound is the occasional rustle of paper and the rhythmic tick-tick of a clock hanging on the wall.
        Shepard Hollis, in his mid-thirties, is hunched over his desk. His unkempt hair falls into his eyes, which are half-lidded with fatigue. His coat, old and worn, hangs loosely over his shoulders. He sips from his coffee mug, his eyes scanning a set of documents.
